# Coding Drills
## Reflections
* Reflection1 -
 I was very excited to solve mathematics related computing problems. The first problem J1 was easy. I thought it would take me just half an hour but then I reviewed JavaScript DOM structure and it took me an hour to finish the first problem. I felt confident and motivated to take little difficult challenge further. It is very good practice to exercise your brain with such coding problems and gives motivation and confidence to try more and more.To improve, I can add more validation later to my code.
J3 was looking challenging but after I started cracking the formula on paper, I became confident that I can do this, followed step by step problem and solved it in 5 hours.

* Reflection2-
The initial thought about the problem was that it is a bit challenging. It is difficult to understand how to put everything together and how to link everything like by employees ids. I did some HTML and CSS for now and it took me 2 hours. I started by making plans with pen and paper that how I will be putting all the elements together and where I will be using 'div' and 'img'. I think it will take me about 4 hours to finish it. If I am able to finish this exercise accurately, it will be another achievement for me and a boost in my confidence.

* Reflection3-
I want to know what are the problems a beginner faces when enters into the field. I am hoping to get information from the guest speaker about their experience as a beginner. To improve my code in the coding interview exercise, I will make it scalable and responsive. I will change the id's to classes so that I can style at once and use it again and again. I started to get the exercise to MVP for now but later I will improve it to get all three perspectives.
* Reflection4-
I was hoping that employers come and they share their views on the work we have done and they could hire some of us. But due to COVID, many businesses and industries have been affected. My experience was pretty good as I gained some confidence to present my work in front of industry expertise. I think practicing more such kind of occasions and meet up with people give you more information and tell you where you need to grow more.
* Reflection5-
I have finished with vue.js exercises. I liked working with vue.js. Building board game looks interesting and 
according to me, I think it will be a bit challenging and brain-storming at the same time as it is a game.
 I want to learn more about vue.js as I am enjoying working with it so far.
 I will try to complete it with full functionality but off course can add more later on and can learn more about vue.js 
 as this will be a very busy week with other work to do. So, I cannot confidently present the game yet but can decide milestones to finish it with proper functionality in the future after applying robustness to the code. I think it will take about 16 hours to design and make the least functional.
 * Reflection6 - 
 I designed Guess game. I took the idea from the vue6 exercise and insteaf of circles , i changed to squares. I want to build the game when user makes a right guess,
 the smiley picture is shown but when user makes the wrong guess, sad emoji picture is shown.
