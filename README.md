# Coding Drills
## Reflections
* Reflection1 - I was very excited to solve mathematics related computing problems. The first problem J1 was easy. I thought it would take me just half an hour but then I reviewed JavaScript DOM structure and it took me an hour to finish the first problem. I felt confident and motivated to take little difficult challenge further. It is very good practice to exercise your brain with such coding problems and gives motivation and confidence to try more and more.To improve, I can add more validation later to my code.
J3 was looking challenging but after I started cracking the formula on paper, I became confident that I can do this, followed step by step problem and solved it in 5 hours.
