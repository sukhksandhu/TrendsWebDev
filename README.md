## Reflections
* Reflection1 - I was very excited to solve mathematical related computing problems. The first problem J1 was easy. I thought it would take me just half an hour but then I reviewed javascript DOM structure and it took me an hour to finish the first problem. I felt confident and motivated to take little difficult challenge further. It is very good practice to exercise your brain with such coding problems and gives motivation and confidence to try more and more.
